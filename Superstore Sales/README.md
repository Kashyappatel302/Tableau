**Superstore Sales Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing retail sales performance for a US-based superstore. The project explores 10,000+ transactions to uncover regional trends, product profitability patterns, and customer segment behavior, delivering actionable business recommendations.**

**Objective**
Analyze sales, profit, and discount data for a retail superstore to identify top-performing and underperforming regions, discover which product sub-categories drive profit versus erode margins, detect seasonal trends in revenue, understand customer segment contribution to overall business, and deliver data-driven recommendations to improve profitability.

**Dataset**
Source: Sample Superstore Dataset — Kaggle
The dataset contains approximately 10,000 order records spanning four years of transaction history. It covers four geographic regions (East, West, South, Central), three customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office), three product categories (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology) broken into 17 sub-categories, and key financial measures including sales, profit, quantity, and discount.

**Process**
The work started with connecting the Superstore CSV to Tableau and exploring the dataset to understand the breakdown of dimensions and measures. The data was clean enough to work with directly, though attention was paid to negative profit values and outlier discount rates that would influence the analysis.
Six views were built across individual worksheets. KPI scorecards were created for total sales, total profit, total quantity, and average discount by placing measures on the Text mark and formatting them as large, bold summary numbers. A regional sales bar chart was built by placing Region on Columns and Sales on Rows, then color-coding by region and sorting descending to create an immediate visual hierarchy. A monthly sales trend line was created using Order Date as a continuous month on Columns against Sales on Rows, with markers added at data points and an optional trend line overlaid to show overall direction. A profit-by-sub-category horizontal bar chart was built with Sub-Category on Rows and Profit on Columns, using a diverging color palette mapped to profit values so that profitable and unprofitable product lines are visually separated. A treemap was created to show the intersection of Category and Segment with Sales driving the size encoding. A filled geographic map was generated by double-clicking State, then mapping Sales to color intensity to show where revenue concentrates across the US.
These six sheets were assembled into a single dashboard using a structured layout with KPI cards spanning the top row and the four analytical views arranged in a two-by-two grid below. Each chart was set to Fit Entire View to maximize space usage. Dropdown filters for Region, Segment, Category, and Sub-Category were added and configured to apply across all worksheets using the same data source. Filter actions were created so that clicking on any element in one chart dynamically filters all connected charts, enabling conversational data exploration. Custom tooltips were designed for each view to surface supplementary metrics on hover.
Final formatting involved applying a consistent color palette, removing unnecessary gridlines and borders, using clean typography with larger bold fonts for KPI values and smaller regular fonts for labels, and customizing the dashboard title and subtitle. The completed dashboard was saved as a .twbx workbook and published to Tableau Public.

**Key Findings**
The West region leads in total sales at roughly $725K, accounting for about 32% of revenue, while the South region underperforms at approximately $392K. Three sub-categories — Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies — show consistent negative profit, primarily driven by discount rates averaging 25–35%. November and December sales consistently spike 40–60% above the monthly average, indicating strong holiday seasonality. The Consumer segment accounts for nearly 50% of all sales, though the Corporate segment shows higher profit margins per transaction. Technology is the most profitable category overall despite having fewer orders than Office Supplies.

**Recommendations**
Reduce discounting on Tables and Bookcases by capping discounts at 15% to recover eroded margins. Increase marketing investment in the South region where the performance gap relative to other regions suggests untapped demand. Prioritize Corporate segment outreach for Technology products where margins are strongest. Build Q4 inventory and campaign plans early, stocking up in October and launching promotions in early November to capture the seasonal surge.

**Tools and Techniques**
Tableau Public was used for all visualization and dashboard design. Chart types include bar charts, line charts, treemaps, geographic filled maps, and KPI scorecards. Tableau features applied include calculated fields, filter actions, cross-filtering, custom tooltips, diverging color palettes, and trend lines. The project covers exploratory data analysis, KPI design, interactive dashboard development, and business storytelling through data.
